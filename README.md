# Sliders Timer Replica

Welcome to the **Sliders Timer Replica** project! This project faithfully recreates the iconic "Timer" from the TV show _Sliders_, a device used for traveling between parallel universes. This replica is based on an Arduino microcontroller and includes electronic components, 3D design files, and the necessary schematics to build the casing and PCB.

## Project Content

- **Source Code**: Arduino sketch to control the Timer.
- **STL Files**: 3D models for printing the Timer casing.
- **Electronic Schematic**: Complete circuit diagrams for assembling the components.
- **Gerber Files**: Files for fabricating the PCB.
- **Photos**: Images of the completed Timer and various construction stages.

## Features

- **Visual and Functional Replica**: Design inspired by the _Sliders_ Timer, featuring an LED display to simulate the countdown.
- **Arduino Timer**: The Timer uses an Arduino microcontroller to handle the countdown and display functions.
- **3D Printable Casing**: All the necessary files to 3D print the casing are included in STL format.
- **DIY PCB**: The schematic and Gerber files allow you to build your own PCB for the Timer.
- **Easily Modifiable**: The code and schematics are provided for you to modify or improve as needed.

## Required Materials

To build this project, you will need the following:

- **Arduino Microcontroller** (e.g., Arduino Nano or similar)
- **7-segment LED display** or equivalent
- **Push buttons** for controls
- **Resistors, capacitors, etc.** (see the electronic schematic for a full list of components)
- **PCB** (Gerber files included for fabrication)
- **3D printed casing** (STL files provided)

### Component List
